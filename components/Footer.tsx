            I didn't have many ideas for the footer so let me tell you a story, once upon a time a boy named Yoan Saint
            Juste decided to create a website. Yoan loves video games so naturally a idea arised, it seemed like a funny
            enough idea, do you think you can guess what that idea was ?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex-1 p-2">
          <h1 className="pb-2 text-xl font-bold">VIDEO GAMES</h1>
          <p className="text-base">
            Yeah this idea had to do with video games, what if I created a fake videogame boutique the boy said to
            himself. And then boom ! He started realizing his idea. He needed a name for his idea which was simple to
            find. Some of the people close to him call him Yoyo sometimes he likes it so he took it, then he had to find
            something related to games.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex-1 p-2">
          <h1 className="pb-2 text-xl font-bold">YOYO GAMES</h1>
          <p className="text-base">
            Was created using a handfull of tools, React, Next, TailwindCSS and Headless UI by the Tailwind team. The
            boy decided to use Tailwind instead of using Material-UI that he really likes and uses most of the time for
            his other projects, he felt like Tailwind made him closer to CSS even though he doesn't really like CSS.
